## Requirements
Included at the top level is **requirements.txt**. To use, run 

    pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt

in the environment which you are running Python.

## Running 'assignment_1.py'

To run the main script, open a Command Prompt or Terminal window at the base project folder (cot-4500-as1). Then, run

    python "src/main/assignment_1.py"

The requirements.txt may be empty because I am using a venv for these assignments. Thus only needed modules will be installed.
